Besides the more general [RoadMap] and the issues of the apps, here are the things you can help us with during the sprint.

=Suggestions=

<wiki:toc max_depth="5" />

== import vs. get_app() ==

Figure out how to check if an app is installed correctly, e.g. [http://code.google.com/p/django-email-confirmation/source/detail?r=40 issue 40 of django-email-confirmation]

==flavored projects==

  * rename the "complete_project" to something more fitting, e.g. "social_project" [JT: wait until we have something it doesn't include]
  * rethink the clone_project script and think about management command
  * move content_project in its own branch for further development if required apps not ready (talk to django-page-cms/django-cms developers)

==app inclusion==

  * decide which apps fit best to the roadmap toward 1.0
  * evaluate unused apps

==Preparation towards moving away from svn:externals==

In favor of:

====pip/virtualenv====

  * figure out how to deal with boot straping virtualenvs
  * write pip requirement/freeze files for the example projects
  * make sure every app used has a valid setup.py
  * docs

=====How to enable apps to be used with pip=====

Your app requires a basic [http://docs.python.org/distutils/setupscript.html setup.py] file to be used with pip.

If the app is going to be used in Pinax from a VCS you also need to make sure it uses [http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools setuptools] in the setup.py because it enables pip to use a checkout without installing it completely (with [http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools#develop-deploy-the-project-source-in-development-mode setuptools' develop command]).

A simple example is (from [http://github.com/ericflo/django-pagination/blob/4862731dd2d89e8491cbb188788e53ed1cf27b51/setup.py django-pagination]):

{{{
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

version = '1.0.5'

setup(
    name='django-pagination',
    version=version,
    description="django-pagination",
    classifiers=[
        "Framework :: Django",
        "Programming Language :: Python",
        "Environment :: Web Environment",
        'Intended Audience :: Developers',
        'Operating System :: OS Independent',
    ],
    keywords='pagination,django',
    author='Eric Florenzano',
    author_email='floguy@gmail.com',
    url='http://django-pagination.googlecode.com/',
    license='BSD',
    packages=find_packages(),
    include_package_data=True,
    zip_safe=False,
)
}}}

_and_

====buildout====

  * revisit eventual existing buildout recipes, write pinaxrecipe based on djangorecipe
  * try integration of pip with buildout ([http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gp.recipe.pip gp.recipe.pip])
  * docs

== Removing django-things ==

In light of the recent breakages with Django trunk [JT: and 1.0.2], and at the author's suggestion, the use of django-things can be removed during the course of a sprint.

== CSS and JS ==

Break out into apps-specific templates and build into a single file for production.

== Groups Re-write ==

== Account Re-write ==

== Go through all outstanding issues ==

Here and on dependent apps and assess whether we need to do them for 0.7

== Make sure locations is properly integrated ==

== Make sure schedule is property integrated ==

== Improve smoke test and automatically run regularly ==

== Improve Fixtures ==

== look at photologue 3 and ImageKit ==

* look at what is new and how things are split
