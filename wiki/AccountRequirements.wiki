#summary requirements for accounts in next Pinax release
#labels Phase-Requirements

Site developers *may* want their site to:

  * ACC-1: not support openid at all
  * ACC-2: *only* use openid and not username passwords at all
  * ACC-3: not have any signup, just rely on admin-created accounts (with a temp password emailed *or* admin just adds the openid)
  * ACC-4: have a waiting list where users "apply" for an account and an admin approves (with batch support)
  * ACC-5: be in private beta where users get a certain number of invites they can hand out
  * ACC-6: use token-based password reset rather than emailing passwords
  * ACC-7: support multiple levels of user (although this isn't the place to manage permissions or subscription payments)
  * ACC-8: allow people to use their primary email address as an alternative to username when logging in
  * ACC-9: not have usernames at all and just use email address (this is a significant change throughout the rest of the apps, I suspect)
  * ACC-10: require email confirmation before login can take place
  * ACC-11: let the user in on signup but still require them to click on token url in email to be allowed to login subsequently
  * ACC-12: resend signup email confirmations with exponential backoff (also spread across day of the week)
  * ACC-13: integrate with LDAP for authentication
