#summary Getting the source

= Getting Source from SVN =

Development is done using SVN. You can get our source code by executing the following in a command prompt:

{{{
svn checkout http://svn.pinaxproject.com/pinax/trunk pinax
}}}

This will checkout the latest line of development into the directory named `pinax`. This is the development version of Pinax and major changes will land and can break your source code between commits. To follow along with development we have setup a quick script to handle this.  Check it out [http://pinaxproject.com/svnlog.py here].
