#summary Getting the source

= Getting Source from SVN =

Development is done using SVN. You can get our source code by executing the following in a command prompt:

{{{
svn checkout https://svn.pinaxproject.com/pinax/trunk pinax
}}}

This will checkout the latest line of development into the directory named `pinax`. We do our best to ensure commits do not break anything, but do keep in mind it is a development version.
