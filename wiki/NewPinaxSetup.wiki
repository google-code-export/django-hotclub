=New Pinax Setup=

The following steps will lead you through the setup pinax trunk on ubuntu 8.10 to run with the production server using SQLite:

Update the packages list:

{{{
$ sudo apt-get update
}}}

pinax is built from several packages that are hosted on svn, git and bzr so we need to install them:

{{{
$ sudo apt-get install subversion git-core bzr
}}}

virtualenv will be used to create an isolated enviorement with all the required python modules including django and pinax:

{{{
$ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
}}}

The python PIL is required for image processing:

{{{
$ sudo apt-get install python-imaging
}}}

The boot script will create a virtualenv named pina-env and add pinax and django to it .

Download it for example to /home/username

{{{
$ wget http://svn.pinaxproject.com/pinax/trunk/script/pinax-boot.py
}}}

Run the script:

{{{
$ python pinax-boot.py pinax-env
}}}

Activating the script will change the $PATH to point to the virtualenv bin/ directory and update your promt

{{{
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv#activate-script
}}}

Now when you'll call python someScript.py it will be running inside your virtualenv scope rather then the global python scope:

when you are on /home/username/development/pinax-env run:

{{{
$ source bin/activate
}}}

We will use pip to download all the packages spreaded across git, svn and bzr.

{{{
pip install --requirement /home/username/pinax-env/src/pinax/requirements/external_apps.txt
}}}

Pinax is shiped with several predefined projects. We'll use the basic_project as a simple example.

We'll create the SQLite database using the django manage.py script.

It'll ask you if you want to create

move to /home/username/pinax-env/src/pinax/projects/basic_project

and run:

{{{
$ python manage.py syncdb
}}}

django has a development server which make tests easy but is not suitable for production.

{{{
$ python manage.py runserver.
}}}

now you can use a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 and see the basic_project

When you want to update the code you have to update both pinax and the apps.

When you are in the src/pinax folder run:

{{{
$ svn update
}}}

to update the apps run:

{{{
pip install --requirement /home/username/pinax-env/src/pinax/requirements/external_apps.txt
}}}
