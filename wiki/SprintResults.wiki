#summary what we've achieved in this sprint

== common templates directory ==

Templates that are common (or potentially common) between projects have now been moved out of projects all together and put under /templates/default/

See /templates/README for more detail

== Removing django-things ==

In light of the recent breakages with Django trunk [JT: and 1.0.2], and at the author's suggestion, the use of django-things was removed during the course of the sprint.
