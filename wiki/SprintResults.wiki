#summary what we've achieved in this sprint

== common templates directory ==

Templates that are common (or potentially common) between projects have now been moved out of projects all together and put under /templates/default/

See /templates/README for more detail

== Removing django-things ==

In light of the recent breakages with Django trunk [JT: and 1.0.2], and at the author's suggestion, the use of django-things was removed during the course of the sprint.

== Moved closer to getting rid of svn:externals ==

There are now basic requirement files for most of the apps and libs that will soon be used to create project requirement files. Made sure every app used has a valid setup.py. Assisted in adding a lot of setup.py files.

== common media directory ==

In preparation for moving common media files to a common directory we've added a build_media management command that traverses app, common and project media dirs to build a site_media directory. There is also a view for serving static files during development that nows where to look for the files.
